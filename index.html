        Who is Wesley, and what are his works?
      </h2>
      <h3>
        An excellent question. I am a video production specialist with skills in all aspects of bringing the magic of motion pictures to life. I graduated from the University of Missouri in 2022 with a Bachelor of Arts in documentary journalism and a minor in history. It's there I discovered my passion for post-production, and have been focused on that since. As an editor first and foremost, I have had the fortune to work with clients such as the world famous Saint Louis Chess Club, Elsevier Education, United States Air Force, and more. I hope to one day help bring to life some of history's greatest stories through the medium of film and television, in the likes of some of my favorite productions such as The Last Kingdom and 1917.
